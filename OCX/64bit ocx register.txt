We have just had the same problem and have now worked out how to do it. 
You need to copy the MSCOMCT2.OCX file to c:\windows\sysWOW64 not c:\windows\system32. 
You then can register it by running from the command prompt or run in the 
start menu regsvr32 c:\windows\sysWOW64\mscomct2.ocx and it 
should register although make sure that you run regsvr32 with administrator privileges.



Hi, You need to put the MSCOMCT2.OCX in the same folder as your program.   Eg. if your program is in C:\MyApp folder, then put the MSCOMCT2.OCX file in C:\MyApp folder too.

 

and create a shortcut and run  %systemroot%\SysWoW64\regsvr32.exe C:\MyApp\MSCOMCT2.OCX   as administrator.
